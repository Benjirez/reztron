<item><hk>ebtechhe</hk><desc>ebtech Hum Eliminator</desc><tx>Typically, the noise commonly encountered in a multi-amp setup does not have the power supply (for the effect pedals, etc) as a root cause. Instead, it is the result of the signals feeding/connecting the amps not being isolated.<br><br>In such cases, using an audio isolation transformer product such as the <a href="http://www.morleypedals.com/hum-eliminators/">Ebtech Hum Eliminator</a> is generally a great solution, and what I recommend.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br><br>Thanks for the inquiry and please let me know if you would like additional assistance.<br></tx></item>

<item><hk>rmaanw</hk><desc>RMA Australia Non-Warranty</desc><tx>Unfortunately, warranty repair of a USA model supply is not available in Australia.<br><br>We are glad to inspect and repair your Pedal Power 2 Plus but you would need to pay the cost of shipping, <i>both ways</i).<br><br>As this may not be feasible due to the shipping expense, I could instead simply send you the necessary 120VAC replacement transformer, price: <i>USD $18.00 + shipping</i>. And, you would need to fine a local technician to do the repair*.<br><br>*Note, our Australia distributor (<b>EGM</b>) will not have parts for repairing a USA model supply but once you have the replacement 120VAC transformer, you could inquire with them about a non-warranty repair.
